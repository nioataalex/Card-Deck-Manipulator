 NOW YOU SEE ME - CARD DECK MANIPULATOR

What I've learned from this project:
- more about header files
- how a linked list works
- generic data structures
- pointers at a functions

First of all, the problem starts with reading an action. After this,
each action will be solved. Also, I used c files and headers with
suggestive names.(main.c,,functions.c etc.)
Each function is explained in the program.

I will explain each action now:

1. ADD_DECK:
- adds a new deck in the lists of decks
- the number of cards is given from the stdin and they will be added in the deck

2. DEL_DECK:
- deletes a deck with the given index from the list of deck

3. DEL_CARD:
- deletes a card with the given index from the deck with the given index

4. ADD_CARDS:
- add a given number of cards in a deck with a given index
- similar with the ADD_DECK 

5. DECK_NUMBER:
- shows the number of decks from the lists of decks

6. DECK_LEN:
- shows the length of a deck with a given index

7. SHUFFLE_DECK:
- shuffles the deck with a given index
- the first half is reversed with the second half

8. MERGE_DECKS:
- merge 2 decks with given indexes
- the decks will be deleted from the list of decks
- the new deck will be add at the final of the list

9. SPLIT_DECK
- split a deck with the given index in 2
- the index where the deck will be splitted is given by the stdin
- the first list will take place of the original one
- the second list will be the next

10. REVERSE_DECK
- reverse a deck with the given index

11. SHOW_DECK
- prints the cards from a deck with the given index

12. SHOW_ALL
- prints the cards from all decks

13. EXIT
- the program will stop
- frees the memory from the list of decks

14. SORT_DECK
- sorts the decks with a given index in ascending order or after the priority of the symbols {HEART, SPADE, DIAMOND, CLUB}

Also, I will explain the errors:

1. DECK_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS:
- appears if the index of a card is negative or is bigger than the size of the list of decks

2. CARD_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS:
- appears if the index of a card is negative or is bigger than the size of the deck

3. INVALID_CARD:
- appears if the symbol is not one of this:{HEART, SPADE, DIAMOND, CLUB} or if the value is not in the between 1 and 14

4. INVALID_COMMAND:
- appears if the command is not one of the 14 given commands

After every successful operation or error, the output will display
a suggestive message.
